    Video Game

Decided on Game where user guesses which team out of two a twitter post is in support of.
Machine Learning algorithm takes tweets from followers of two different sports team rivals. 
Then will take one more tweet and guess which team the twitter user is a fan of. The player
will then guess which team the twitter user is a fan of, and if their hypothesis matches the player
gets a point. If they don't then the game is over. There will also be a local leaderboard. 
Think of it as a rendition of the "Higher vs Lower" game.
