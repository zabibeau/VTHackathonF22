@occamscomb @solid2gas @pslweb except the person you are responding to.
@pslweb you responded to someone who said it genius.
@pslweb now do the house....then talk about fairness.
@cernovich we've seen this before people. "little rocket man?" trump makes enemies then brings them back into the fold.
@melmc31 @timrunshismouth there is nothing successful about this election...no matter who wins.
