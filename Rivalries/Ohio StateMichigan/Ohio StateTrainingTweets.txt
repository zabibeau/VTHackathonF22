@jahenss lol i'm not the only one
@rabo12 haha off the board i like it! all fine upstanding gentlemen that are just misunderstood
@rabo12 i would choose mixon of the following but who would u take a chance on if u had too? pacman, randy gregory or mixon?
barrett needs to take his diaper off
how many times will harbaugh cry tonight?
@cscho3 and penn st can cry cause they had 2 losses

@nfl money is good but maybe i should look at the integrity of the game and the loser players to make more money
@cscho3 got fucked by the timing of a loss to a top 5 team would've been better than the 2 losers last night

@cletisstump and.... i didn't insult you once.
@cletisstump ok. but the question is still valid. "intervention in syria" -against who? our enemies? which side would that be?
if the crips and bloods go to war, should we intervene, sell weapons to 1 side, or lock em in a stadium together and wish em best of luck?
